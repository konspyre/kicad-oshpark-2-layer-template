# KiCad - OSHPark 2 Layer PCB Service template

Creating a project using this template will set your PCB design limits
to those of OSHPark's 2 layer service.

This template was created by following OSHPark's [KiCad setup guide](https://docs.oshpark.com/design-tools/kicad/kicad-design-rules/). Optional/suggested details have been left out for the user to decide upon, aside from layer setup where optional layers have been kept.
